010-categorical-predictors
==========================

Hastie-Tibshirani-Friedman,
in Section 9.2.4 of The Elements of Statistical Learning (2009),
mentioned that, when the response variable is (non-ordered) binary,
a simplified best-split search strategy is known
for (non-ordered) categorical predictor variables.
This task contains experiments to see whether it is possible to adapt
that simplified best-split search strategy for nppCART.
